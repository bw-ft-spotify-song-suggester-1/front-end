# Spotify Song Suggester

### Summary
This app was created using React. All of our components are being rendered through App.js and routed using React-Router-DOM.
#### Login/Sign Up
Components are validated using Yup while API requests are accomplished using Axios.
#### Dashboard
This component is our user facing *all or nothing* component. Within it are other nested components displaying different information. Mostly it contains a **Searchbar** to post and get data from Back End and Data Engineers, and **Carousel** to display the fetched data.

#### Libraries
- react-burger-menu
- slick-carousel

#### What to Change Going Forward
 - Avoid library dependencies for major functionality.
 - Implelement preprocessor to make styling more efficient.
